<!-- $preface Preface -->

<!-- $prefaceParagraph1 The first tale of this ancient book is being restored. Some of the pages are still undeciphered. -->

<!-- $seeAppendix For further details, see in appendix. -->



<!-- $legendParagraph1 A war bursted out between Greece cities and Pharaoh of Egypt at the mythology era. That was a ship war to be the mediterannean sea master. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph2 Boreas supported Greek fleet by blowing into Greek sails fleet... -->

<!-- $legendParagraph3 And Auster did so with Egyptians. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph4 When doing so both winds met. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph5 That was love at first sight due to a Cupid golden arrow.  Cupid was sent by other Gods to prevent Greek and Egyptian from fighting. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph6 Auster and Boreas escaped away not to be sentenced to death for treason. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph7 Auster who was used to crossing Atlantic ocean to America bringing along sand grains informed Boreas about a place where they could live in peace. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph8 In order to sail away quickly from their former fleet allies a new fast sail is invented, that is, a spi Sail. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph9 By blowing into this sail, they escaped from their pursuers and reached <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> point : 0.0.0. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph10 By the time going on, Greeks and Egyptians became friends while searching for the two winds and made peace. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph11 Boreas and Auster got aware of that. They were kindly requested to go back to their respective lands. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph12 Respecting their duty, they broke their love relationship down and got back home. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph13 To celebrate their love and peace the spi sail is handed over to Human being. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph14 People surrounding the <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> point tell now this legend to their children. Nowadays the place where both winds lived their love is named  <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> 0.0.0 point  to honour Boreas and Auster love and to thank to them for the Spi sail and to be under their auspices. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph15 To gratify Human being who celebrates their love Auster pours a sand grain-like tear into some  globe sea specific points. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph16 When a sand grain-like tear touches the sea surface a foarm is generated and a <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> product springs out of it as a present for Humanity. -->

<!-- $legendParagraph17 All <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> products are created out of foarm of the seas generated by the contact between sea and sand grain. -->



<!-- $genesis Genesis -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph1 This ancient book is made of a series of tales and legends. -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph2 To the astonishment of Archeologues, it is said that the texts are written in Anglo Normand language. -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph3 The grimoire gathers several stories which will be released along with the collections and upon their restoration. -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph4 In order to allow <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> to restore this book in a good schedule and with the best result, you can support us by purchasing models of the collection. -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph5 The current collection ''Spi line'' is deeply inspired from Book First chapter one. -->

<!-- $genesisParagraph6 The further <b class="auspibor"><strong>@</strong>AUSPIBOR</b> collections will be inspired accordingly by the other chapters. -->
